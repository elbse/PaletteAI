## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Streamlit** - Web application framework
- **OpenCV** - Image processing
- **scikit-learn** - KMeans clustering algorithm
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** - Color palette visualization

## 📦 Installation

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elbse/PalleteAI.git
cd PalleteAI
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📋 Requirements

```
streamlit>=1.28.0
numpy>=1.24.0
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
```

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Upload an Image**: Click on the upload button and select an image file (JPG, JPEG, or PNG)
2. **Adjust Colors**: Use the sidebar slider to choose how many dominant colors you want to extract (3-10)
3. **View Results**: See the extracted color palette with RGB and HEX values
4. **Download**: Click the download button to save your color palette as a text file

## 🧠 How It Works

The app uses KMeans clustering algorithm to analyze the pixels in your image:

1. The uploaded image is resized to 300x300 pixels for faster processing
2. All pixels are converted into a feature space of RGB values
3. KMeans clustering groups similar colors together
4. The cluster centers represent the dominant colors
5. Results are displayed with visual swatches and color codes

## 🎨 Use Cases

- **Web Design**: Extract color schemes from inspiration images
- **Brand Identity**: Analyze competitor or reference brand colors
- **Art & Design**: Get color palettes from photographs and artwork
- **UI/UX Design**: Generate consistent color schemes for applications
- **Digital Marketing**: Extract colors from images for campaign consistency
